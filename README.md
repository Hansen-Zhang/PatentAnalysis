# PatentAnalysis

# Assignment 
Find and analyze patents that relate to the analysis and prediction of key data elements. 
You have access to two primary data sets i.e. Google Patents (API or search), and Crunchbase.   

Consider scenario:  

You have access to data that describes an ecosystem of companies, founders, investors and 
categories (keywords) allocated to companies. Various approaches and methods are applied when 
analyzing potentially successful companies and people in markets. Which prediction methods can be 
used to determine if a company will be financially successful in the future? Are there methods 
to determine if certain ideas will be more successful than others?  

In the fields of big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, find patents that 
describe an approach to solving this scenario. Produce a network map (ecosystem) of patents. 
Please outline how you would apply the patent/s and develop further unique approaches. 

### Notes  

If you had to think about the intersection of AI/ML/Big Data, there are probably new PATENTABLE techniques. There are already a large stack of filed patents in this space.

##### Plan 
Search for specific techniques that already have patents filed.

##### Use
https://www.google.com/patents/US8700607 images as examples for documenting algorithms.

##### Question
What is it that will determine what is great NEXT?
