This vehicle creates matter on its own providing a foothold in space by ejecting antimatter for propulsion. However, I have gone farther than that by creating an engine that annihilates the antimatter with another generated matter for the safety of our human environment and to maximize matter-antimatter particle reactions for greater propulsion in space. With the Catalasan Nuclear Fusion Reactor coupled with two Electro-Nucleo Genesoids, this engine can travel to the far reaches of interstellar space. With all due respect, please note that this application contains dependent connections to two separate applications called the Catalasan Nuclear Fusion Reactor, a rotating centrifugal laser nuclear fusion reactor, and Electro-Nucleo Genesoids, unlimited energy by matter-antimatter produc",

For complex parts, an experienced machinist makes use of inductive methods to relate similar part material, geometries together with interdependencies and their associated machining sequences which have produced quality parts in the past with minimum time expended, or deductive methods to generate a sequence by relating feature attributes (relative size and position) and relations (intersections and common tooling). Of interest is the interaction between the two methods because their coupling enables a self-improving design system to be realized. A feature-based solid modelling software environment provides the elements of a symbolic language for describing a discrete mechanical part in terms of its product and process design. The language is based on the us",

            "dc.description": "A method and apparatus for a wireless health monitoring system for interactively monitoring a disease or health condition of a patient by connecting an internet-enabled wireless web device (\u201cWWD\u201d) to a health monitoring device which may be a medical device or other health related device. The WWD may be connected to the health monitoring device directly by a wired connection to a generic input/output port of the WWD or wirelessly connected to the health monitoring device, such as via an infrared or radio frequency connection. The health related data is transmitted from the WWD to a server using standard internet protocols. The server calculates a response using a software program while providing for review bt a physician or health specialist. The user may interact with the server, for example, the server transmits a response to the WWD and the user may answer the response or provide other information."

The major technique used for fault diagnostics is a fault diagnostic network (FDN) which is based on a modified ARTMAP neural network architecture. A hypothesis and test procedure based on fuzzy logic and physical bearing models is disclosed to operate with the FDN for detecting faults that cannot be recognized by the FDN and for analyzing complex machine conditions. The procedure described herein is able to provide accurate fault diagnosis for both one and multiple-fault conditions. Furthermore, a transputer-based parallel processing technique is used in which the FDN is implemented on a network of four T800-25 transputers.",
