This utilizes advances in artificial intelligence and expert systems technology for the development of data analysis and information (signal) processors used in conjunction with conventional (deterministic) data analysis algorithms to combine radar measurement data (including observed target tracks and radar clutter returns from terrain, sea, atmospheric effects, etc.) with topographic data, weather information, and similar information to formulate optimum filter coefficients and threshold tests. Present fielded radar systems use one CFAR algorithm for signal processing over the entire surveillance volume. However, radar experiments have shown that certain CFAR algorithms outperform others in different environments.

A wide variety of features can be supported, such as electronic reporting. Pre-hire information identified as ineffective can be removed from a collected pre-hire information. For example, ineffective questions can be identified and removed from a job application. New items can be added and their effectiveness tested.
