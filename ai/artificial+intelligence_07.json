The network system has distributed artificial intelligence and may be used to supply high volume, high speed, multi media, telesthesia, telemetry, telekinesis, telepresence, telemanagement, telecommunications and data processing services. The invention is implemented by means of a non-hierarchical network having a fractal structure. That is, the system is structured as a network of networks that may individually display self-similar characteristics at all levels of aggregation at which they are considered. The system and its constituent networks are structurally coupled with their environment through hermeneutic processes. These processes are not based on, and do not use, a priori representations of their environment or of the networks themselves. The system includes a number of cybernetic devices which are adapted to function as both the infrastructure of the network and the means by which the network services are delivered to network users.

The mathematical model is an algorithm of the form R = [1262.79]f\u00b2/r. The model is linearized and initialized to give the form R = \u03b2\u2081sRf+\u03b2\u2082Rmax where R is the actual roughness and Rmax is desired roughness, f is actual feed, \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082 are coefficients to be updated by estimation, and sR is a scale factor chosen to make the first term have the same order of magnitude as the second term.

A semantic network uses multiple links to indicate that different pattern components of user's behavioral access create different kinds of relationships and \u201csymbolic representations\u201d. A neural network is trained by using each of the owner's timing vectors in the training set as an input. When a user inputs the owner's login name and password, it's checked and the user's timing vector is extracted to type the user's password if checked and demoted in confidence level if otherwise. The user's timing vector is applied to neural network and difference between the input/output is compared with a predetermined threshold; and if the difference is greater than the threshold, is prohibited. Preferably this is aided by response time to personal questions.",
