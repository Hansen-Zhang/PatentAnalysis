The WWD may be connected to the health monitoring device directly by a wired connection to a generic input/output port of the WWD or wirelessly connected to the health monitoring device, such as via an infrared or radio frequency connection. The health related data is transmitted from the WWD to a server using standard internet protocols. The server calculates a response using a software program while providing for review bt a physician or health specialist. The user may interact with the server, for example, the server transmits a response to the WWD and the user may answer the response or provide other information."

The major technique used for fault diagnostics is a fault diagnostic network (FDN) which is based on a modified ARTMAP neural network architecture. A hypothesis and test procedure based on fuzzy logic and physical bearing models is disclosed to operate with the FDN for detecting faults that cannot be recognized by the FDN and for analyzing complex machine conditions. The procedure described herein is able to provide accurate fault diagnosis for both one and multiple-fault conditions. Furthermore, a transputer-based parallel processing technique is used in which the FDN is implemented on a network of four T800-25 transputers.",
