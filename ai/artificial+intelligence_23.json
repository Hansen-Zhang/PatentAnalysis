The aircraft data is also compared with a knowledge base of air traffic control rules for the particular airport involved. An inference engine written in LISP (or another AI language) allows real time access to the knowledge base. The position and heading of each aircraft is monitored and controlled until turned over to the tower for final approach.

This utilizes advances in artificial intelligence and expert systems technology for the development of data analysis and information (signal) processors used in conjunction with conventional (deterministic) data analysis algorithms to combine radar measurement data (including observed target tracks and radar clutter returns from terrain, sea, atmospheric effects, etc.) with topographic data, weather information, and similar information to formulate optimum filter coefficients and threshold tests. Present fielded radar systems use one CFAR algorithm for signal processing over the entire surveillance volume. However, radar experiments have shown that certain CFAR algorithms outperform others in different environments. The system intelligently senses the clutter environment, and selects and combines the most app",
