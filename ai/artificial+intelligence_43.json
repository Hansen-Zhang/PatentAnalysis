Information from different sources and uncertainties from detections, are integrated within the bilattice framework. Automated logical rule weight learning in the computer vision domain applies a rule weight optimization method which casts the instantiated inference tree as a knowledge-based neural network, to converge upon a set of rule weights that give optimal performance within the bilattice framework. Applications are in (a) detecting the presence of humans under partial occlusions and (b) detecting large complex man made structures in satellite imagery (c) detection of spatio-temporal human and vehicular activities in video and (c) parsing of Graphical User Interfaces."

A student can log on the system through a website to review training history, to access a menu of levels of practice examinations of interest to him, and to select training exams on the website. During the examination, the student is able to indicate whether or not help is required at any given point or question. Without regard to whether or not the student believes help is required, all students are subject to a dynamic/interactive evaluation of responses in which a teacher who is on-line with the same website at the time of the student is able to intervene during an examination to invoke help options for the student. In the first instance, the teacher can intervene to change the exam level to either a lower or to a higher one. Among the help options available to a student during an examination within a given level are \u201cauto coach\u201d in which the student is provided with hints and examples; an adaptive question selection in which variations of th",
