Information from different sources and uncertainties from detections, are integrated within the bilattice framework. Automated logical rule weight learning in the computer vision domain applies a rule weight optimization method which casts the instantiated inference tree as a knowledge-based neural network, to converge upon a set of rule weights that give optimal performance within the bilattice framework. Applications are in (a) detecting the presence of humans under partial occlusions and (b) detecting large complex man made structures in satellite imagery (c) detection of spatio-temporal human and vehicular activities in video and (c) parsing of Graphical User Interfaces."

The question processor processes the initial user query to identify a set of possible well-formed questions selected from the question database, where a well-formed question is a question in the database that is coupled to at least one answer reference. The answer reference is typically either an answer or a pointer to a possible location of an answer. In a specific embodiment, the information server is coupled to the Internet so that users can pose questions using a Web browser from any Internet-connected device.
