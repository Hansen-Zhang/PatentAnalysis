The autonomous submersible aquatic drone comprises a shaped housing, a propulsion system, one or more electromotors, a camera, a sonar unit, a wireless transponder, a battery, a microcontroller unit, and a control hardware unit. The control hardware unit is configured with artificial intelligence logic. The submersible drone surveys a predetermined area around a person engaged in a water sport for the presence of an underwater threat. When the aquatic drone detects the presence of an underwater threat the submersible drone sends a warning signal to a control unit worn by the person. The aquatic drone may also have a threat response unit to deter an attack on the person.",

The aircraft data is also compared with a knowledge base of air traffic control rules for the particular airport involved. An inference engine written in LISP (or another AI language) allows real time access to the knowledge base. The position and heading of each aircraft is monitored and controlled until turned over to the tower for final approach.
