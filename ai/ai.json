A semantic network uses multiple links to indicate that different pattern components of user's behavioral access create different kinds of relationships and “symbolic representations”. A neural network is trained by using each of the owner's timing vectors in the training set as an input. When a user inputs the owner's login name and password, it's checked and the user's timing vector is extracted to type the user's password if checked and demoted in confidence level if otherwise. The user's timing vector is applied to neural network and difference between the input/output is compared with a predetermined threshold; and if the difference is greater than the threshold, is prohibited. Preferably this is aided by response time to personal questions.","og:site_name":"Google Books"}],"cse_image":[{"src":"http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/US8583574B2/US08583574-20131112-D00002.png"}]},"htmlSnippet":"Nov 12, 2013 <b>...</b> Method of and apparatus for combining <b>artificial intelligence</b> (AI) concepts with <br>\nevent-driven security architectures and ideas.

According to the methods and processes, well log data measurements from neutron spectroscopy applications and associated tool response parameters are solved using an artificial intelligence system, such as an expert system, which in turn generates an appropriate discriminator and/or compositional model that estimates both general and specific lithology as well as the mineralogy constraints of the subterranean formation being analyzed. The methods exhibit good elemental correlation between conventional methods of lithology and mineralogy determination, and can provide numerous output data, including grain density and porosity data within zones of the formation."}],"cse_image":[{"src":"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/thumbnails/US8101907B2/US08101907-20120124-D00002.png"}]},"htmlSnippet":"Jan 24, 2012 <b>...</b> The method of claim 8 , wherein the <b>artificial intelligence</b> system is selected from <br>\nthe group consisting of expert systems, neural networks,&nbsp;...","title":"Patent US8101907 - Methods for quantitative lithological and ...","snippet":"Jan 24, 2012 ...
