The interface is rearranged to cover any gaps. Additionally, the user is tracked to websites that the user frequents. Links to those websites are given emphasis on the rearranged user interface. The user is notified if changes are made to a favored website. The user is rewarded with discounts and other prizes for frequently going to a particular website.",

The network system has distributed artificial intelligence and may be used to supply high volume, high speed, multi media, telesthesia, telemetry, telekinesis, telepresence, telemanagement, telecommunications and data processing services. The invention is implemented by means of a non-hierarchical network having a fractal structure. That is, the system is structured as a network of networks that may individually display self-similar characteristics at all levels of aggregation at which they are considered. The system and its constituent networks are structurally coupled with their environment through hermeneutic processes. These processes are not based on, and do not use, a priori representations of their environment or of the networks themselves. The system includes a number of cybernetic devices which are adapted to function as both the infrastructure of the network and the means by which the network services are delivered to network users.

For autism, the instrument can be a caregiver-directed set of questions designed for an autism classification tool or an observation of the subject in a video, video conference, or in person and associated set of questions about behavior that are designed for use in a separate autism classification tool. The computer system can have one or more processors and memory to store one or more computer programs having instructions for generating a highly statistically accurate set of diagnostic items selected from the instrument, which are tested against a first test using a technique using artificial intelligence and a second test against an independent source. Also, a computer implemented method and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium are disclosed.",

The mathematical model is an algorithm of the form R = [1262.79]f\u00b2/r. The model is linearized and initialized to give the form R = \u03b2\u2081sRf+\u03b2\u2082Rmax where R is the actual roughness and Rmax is desired roughness, f is actual feed, \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082 are coefficients to be updated by estimation, and sR is a scale factor chosen to make the first term have the same order of magnitude as the second term.

A neural network is trained by using each of the owner's timing vectors in the training set as an input. When a user inputs the owner's login name and password, it's checked and the user's timing vector is extracted to type the user's password if checked and demoted in confidence level if otherwise. The user's timing vector is applied to neural network and difference between the input/output is compared with a predetermined threshold; and if the difference is greater than the threshold, is prohibited.
