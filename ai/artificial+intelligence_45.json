The question processor processes the initial user query to identify a set of possible well-formed questions selected from the question database, where a well-formed question is a question in the database that is coupled to at least one answer reference. The answer reference is typically either an answer or a pointer to a possible location of an answer. In a specific embodiment, the information server is coupled to the Internet so that users can pose questions using a Web browser from any Internet-connected device.

This vehicle creates matter on its own providing a foothold in space by ejecting antimatter for propulsion. However, I have gone farther than that by creating an engine that annihilates the antimatter with another generated matter for the safety of our human environment and to maximize matter-antimatter particle reactions for greater propulsion in space. With the Catalasan Nuclear Fusion Reactor coupled with two Electro-Nucleo Genesoids, this engine can travel to the far reaches of interstellar space. With all due respect, please note that this application contains dependent connections to two separate applications called the Catalasan Nuclear Fusion Reactor, a rotating centrifugal laser nuclear fusion reactor, and Electro-Nucleo Genesoids, unlimited energy by matter-antimatter produc",

For complex parts, an experienced machinist makes use of inductive methods to relate similar part material, geometries together with interdependencies and their associated machining sequences which have produced quality parts in the past with minimum time expended, or deductive methods to generate a sequence by relating feature attributes (relative size and position) and relations (intersections and common tooling). Of interest is the interaction between the two methods because their coupling enables a self-improving design system to be realized. A feature-based solid modelling software environment provides the elements of a symbolic language for describing a discrete mechanical part in terms of its product and process design. The language is based on the us",
