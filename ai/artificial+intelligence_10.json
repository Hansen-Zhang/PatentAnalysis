The mathematical model is an algorithm of the form R = [1262.79]f\u00b2/r. The model is linearized and initialized to give the form R = \u03b2\u2081sRf+\u03b2\u2082Rmax where R is the actual roughness and Rmax is desired roughness, f is actual feed, \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082 are coefficients to be updated by estimation, and sR is a scale factor chosen to make the first term have the same order of magnitude as the second term.

A semantic network uses multiple links to indicate that different pattern components of user's behavioral access create different kinds of relationships and \u201csymbolic representations\u201d. A neural network is trained by using each of the owner's timing vectors in the training set as an input. When a user inputs the owner's login name and password, it's checked and the user's timing vector is extracted to type the user's password if checked and demoted in confidence level if otherwise. The user's timing vector is applied to neural network and difference between the input/output is compared with a predetermined threshold; and if the difference is greater than the threshold, is prohibited.
